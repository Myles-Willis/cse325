A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered:
Our biggest issue was getting Task 4 exercise 4 of the lab completed. But Working
together we were able to figure it out. 



Peer Evaluation:
My partner was very helpful in the lab, I was able to work with them without
issues and was able to complete the lab with an even amount of work done.
