$ nice 5 18
System process ID #5 now has nice value: 18

Task 3: Command and Output is pasted below:
$ lab3test &; lab3test &; lab3test &
Parent 5 creating child 9

$ ps

lab3test 	 5 	 SLEEPING 	   10
lab3test 	 7 	 SLEEPING 	   10
lab3test 	 10 	 RUNNING 	   20
lab3test 	 11 	 RUNNABLE 	   20
ps 	 13 	 RUNNING 	   10


Observation: When you run ps at different time intervals as shown above, you
can see that process 10 state is switched to running on the second run of ps. 



Task 4: Command and Output is pasted below:

$ nice 11 5
System process ID #11 now has nice value: 5 
$ ps
name 	 pid 	 state   	 priority
init 	 1 	 SLEEPING 	   10
sh 	 2 	 SLEEPING 	   10
lab3test 	 10 	 RUNNABLE 	   20
lab3test 	 9 	 SLEEPING 	   10
lab3test 	 6 	 SLEEPING 	   10
lab3test 	 8 	 SLEEPING 	   10
lab3test 	 11 	 RUNNING 	   5
lab3test 	 12 	 RUNNABLE 	   20
ps 	 15 	 RUNNING 	   10

Observations: As you can see process 11 becomes runnable when its nice value
is changed to 5(higher priority), thus showing that it is now prioritized
over the other processes.
